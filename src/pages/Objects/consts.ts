export const TITLE = 'The System of Objects';

export const DESCRIPTIONS = [
  `The System of Objects focuses on interior spaces especially modern
  residential spaces. The black and white photographs seem to create a serious
  and solemn atmosphere. However, in this series, through the stacking and
  splicing of objects, it presents absurdity and abnormality: we can see
  staggered beds which are surrounded by circles of surveillance cameras,
  toilets stacked by toilet rings which symbolize "rank", countless light
  bulbs that emit dizzy lights at the same time, interesting visual
  presentation of the term "neat freak", windows facing different
  directions haphazardly, curtains that open but only show an empty wall,
  an absurd indoor viewing device, layers of viaducts that couldn't have
  been there crisscrossing each other and a row of shoes with only the toe
  exposed...Both furniture and other objects are deeply deconstructed and
  reconstructed, presenting a dramatic scene.`,
  `In this context, the manufacture of objects is not only a technical
  issue. Its appearance and function are not only based on aesthetic and
  practical needs, but also show profound sociological principles. People
  project various desires on objects and satisfy themselves by giving them
  some concepts. The proliferation, stacking, and splicing of furniture
  and relative objects blur the boundary between "useful" and "useless".`,
  `Now that the abundance of objects has become an important feature of society,  people no longer surround objects, but objects closely surround people. The System of Objects uncharacteristically removes
  the line of sight from people, and devotes wholeheartedly to the
  performance of objects, hoping to provide a new possibility of
  expressing and understanding objects.`,
