export const description = `Contemporary photographer. Based on the interest in "object"
and "material culture", as well as my childhood experience of talking to
objects and disassembling and reassembling them, my works all focus on
"object", and reconstruct it through defamiliarization, in an attempt to
create an abnormal scene based on reality. Now that the abundance of
objects has become an important feature of society, I hope to explore
new manifestations of objects, and reflect on topics such as the social
meaning of objects and its relationship with people.`;
